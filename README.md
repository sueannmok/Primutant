# Primutant
This is a FREE and SIMPLE program that designs primer pairs used to create arrayed mutagenesis libraries for your protein of interest. The designed primers are optimized for use in our high-throughput cloning pipeline. Links to the pipeline protocol can be found at:https://moklab.biochem.ualberta.ca/Primutant/

This repository the contains necessary python script that generates the same output as GUI found at: https://moklab.biochem.ualberta.ca/Primutant/

To get it to function you will need to first install the primer3 module. The module can be found at: https://pypi.org/project/primer3-py/
The entire primer3 pacakge will need to be copied into your working folder for functionality.

A sample output (Sample_mutagenesis.csv) has been provided in the repository for reference.
